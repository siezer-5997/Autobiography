# Autobiography

Brief description of the project.
In the head section, the lang="en" attribute specifies the language of the document, which is English in this case. The meta tag sets the character encoding for the document. It tells the browser that the document is encoded using UTF-8. There is a title element that specifies the title of the HTML document and a link for a favicon which is the small icon for the tab of the page.
Design: I have categorized my website into a total of five sections.
I.	Profile icon and Name: the first section of the website displays a profile icon with a full name and my current educational and work status. The icon in an <img> tag with a width property set to fit in the table and both with the text are in a <div> block. A table which includes my professional profile photo and general information about my objectives and the major I am pursuing at a graduate level. I used a table format in this stage to separate the written information from my profile photo and make them side to side without using any CSS. Moreover, I decided that a table structure in this section would make it more presentable to a reader and the description refers to the person in the left section. Additionally, when the window is minimized to a smaller size, the design is still somewhat structured which is user-friendly and does not distort the format.

II.	Bio: this section contains my biography which addresses my background and institutions I have attended for my bachelor's degree. I used an <h3> tag for the header to stand out from the paragraph and separated this section with an <hr> tag, which is a horizontal line with size 3 extending through the web page and divide two sections which also made it readable with a good design for the biography.
III.	Educational background and Hobbies sections: I used an unordered list for both sections where I listed a number of educational backgrounds and hobbies, and I also included an image for the hobbies section for visual representation.
IV.	Work experience and Skills sections: In both of these sections, I used a table structure because there are multiple columns, and I wanted to divide this part into three sections to list positions in work experience, location and different skill sets categorized into 3 parts. So, I decided using a table with three rows would be ideal to include all the information neatly.
V.	Lastly there is a contact info section where I used an <a> tag with an img tag and clicking on the social media icons would take the user to the corresponding destination. I think using icons is more interactive from the end-user perspective and upon clicking the icons, a new tab would open since I used a target property with the <a> tag to open a new tab and that way the user would not have to press back to come back to the page.
